1. [ChatGPT] (Navein) Q: How do I create a running tally of counts within a group when using the groupby function in python.

A: Use the .cumcount(), which starts at 0 and tallies the total elements within your group. {This was used for the presidential term tallies in the multi-term word count analysis of part1.ipynb}

3. [ChatGPT] (Navein) Q: How do you efficiently count the frequency of words in a given list?
